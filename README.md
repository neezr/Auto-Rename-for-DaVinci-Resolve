# ~ Auto-Rename ~
Never get confused by generically named Fusion nodes in DaVinci Resolve again.

Automatically rename:

- 'MediaIn' nodes to their file names,
- 'Background' nodes to their colors and
- 'Text+'/'Text3D' nodes to their text contents

All with a single click!


## Usage:
- Open the Fusion page 
- Run this script from DaVinci Resolve's dropdown menu (Workspace > Scripts)
- This will automatically rename all unnamed "MediaIn", "Background", "Text+" and "Text 3D" nodes to logical display names

- This works best if bound to a hotkey! (open hotkey settings with CTRL+ALT+K)

## Install:
- Copy the .lua-file into the folder "%appdata%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Comp"
